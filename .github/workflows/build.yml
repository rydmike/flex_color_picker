# This GitHub action runs on pull request to master, it:
#
#  - Installs dart and flutter
#  - Uses flutter beta channel for now.
#  - Enables flutter web
#  - Gets package dependencies
#  - Runs dart analyze, allows deprecation warnings, we on purpose allow use of deprecated features on beta channel,
#    as they might not yet be deprecated on stable and we will keep using some of the features that are deprecated
#    as long as they are not also deprecated on stable.
#  - Show outdated packages, just added for info.
#  - Verify that dart format is used by all committed code, fails if not. Controversial but pub.dev penalizes you if
#    dart format is not used.
#  - Run all tests with coverage.
#  - Upload code coverage output to Codecov for analysis.
#  - Install linux rpl tool. It is used to automate the needed change of a line in index.html.
#  - Build default and web example apps for FlexColorPicker.
#    - Flutter clean.
#    - Flutter build web app, in release mode and with CanvasKit renderer.
#    - Use rpl to fix/modify the index.html file to give it the correct href deployment sub-folder.
#  - This CI/CD stops here, it does not deploy, that is done by the deploy workflow, that is otherwise identical,
#    but runs on release, when it is published, created or edited.
#
#  TODO: Maybe set this workflow up to also run on a weekly schedule to check that nothing is broken?
#        Also planning to setup a matrix test run, but this one is anyway a nice test
#        since it does not just runs tests, it also builds actual Web apps using the package.
