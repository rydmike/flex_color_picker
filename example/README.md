# Flutter ColorPicker Example

A simple example application using the Flutter ColorPicker package.

## Getting Started

To see the example on a device or simulator, clone the ColorPicker repository and run the example:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run --release
```

The result is a basic default picker on the canvas and one picker that opens in the provided dialog, which is configured to have a few more options present.
