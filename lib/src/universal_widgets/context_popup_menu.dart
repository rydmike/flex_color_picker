/// A context popup menu.
///
/// Wrap a child with [ContextPopupMenu] and provide it a list of
/// [PopupMenuEntry], typically it is a [PopupMenuItem] where each item have a
/// unique value. Often the [PopupMenuItem] has a child of type [ListTile], with
/// and int as value for its list index. The child can also be a custom widget
/// with any type of row content or even images, their values could be an
/// enum for its selection as well.
///
/// The popup menu with the provided entries will show up next to the long press
/// location on the child in a way that fits best on the screen and child.
///
/// The [onSelected] returns the associated value of the selected
/// [PopupMenuEntry]. If the menu is closed without selection, which happens
/// when user clicks outside it, null is returned. In all cases an [onSelected]
/// event also signals that the menu was closed.
///
/// The optional [onOpen] callback event is triggered when the menu is opened.
///
/// The menu can be styled with [PopupMenuThemeData] either via
/// Theme.of(context).PopupMenuThemeData globally for the app and all other
/// popup menus in it, or you can wrap just your custom popup widget that
/// composes its content using [ContextPopupMenu] with a [Theme] that defines
/// the [PopupMenuThemeData] just for that popup menu widget.
